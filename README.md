> Thinking of roles or items or ideas!
### Why did you make this?
This is primarily made for my ideas and considerations for games and not to be taken seriously in any remark,
Just making some ideas to change game mechanics around or various features (I'd like to call it modded)

### Roles
<details><summary>Seraphim</summary>

> These people are always watching the illusioners; every movement, sometimes (they can't tell the difference between themselves and illusioners)
#### Storyline
They were created by the despairs to cause more conflict and pain and revive the dead by prolonging the game.
#### Abilities
- They can heal any character in the game that hasn't been killed in the last (4) rounds or (if the despair allows)
- They can stop illusioners from doing devious things?
- They can give items to "players" on a round basis, depending on (situational pools)
#### Resiliences
- They can only be applied, if their assistant is a doctor & supportive role?
- They can't kill anyone at all, they're only supportive
- Illusioners can give them trouble with the game internally
#### Affinities
#### Seeking (First Affinity)
- Only can stop illusioners from specific tasks
#### Healing (Second Affinity)
- Can only be applied, if their assistant is a doctor/supportive role?
#### ???
- I couldn't think of a third one, I'm sorry?

<details><summary>Illusionist</summary>

> These people are most likely just friends to the despairs to make the game more interesting; this role is only for fast pace matching
#### Storyline
Illusionist were people, who were driven insane by the despairs and want to be super vengeful on their primal desires to destroy and cause conflict and pain within basis of their own needs. 
#### Resiliences
- They cannot attack anyone that hasn't killed or acquired any sort of items (Starting clause only) 
- They cannot interact with players, who have already been targeted by a cheat in that round; they must recharge every (3) rounds and only take place as a spectator for a select (penitence of time)
- If the detective or council figures out, your "monster" illusion or your assistant in the game, you lose by default and can't continue in the game for another (4) rounds and will be selected at random for a new assistant.
- They can interact with the environment; but, they can't move objects around; besides from the doctor's pill and (various objects) selective on the despairs desire.
##### Stage I.
- Only can stop illusioners from specific tasks
- You're not allow to speed up the game, if there's no players involved hardly; you'll need to acquire that from your despair.
- They can take people into torture realities or dimensions basis on the game!
- They can get information about people within boundaries of their subconscious mind.
- They're also known for being cheaters in every round and keep balance in the game for extended periods of time every (3) rounds
- They can take anyone out within (8) rounds by taking them into the abyssal illusions of their mind and killing them from existence!
##### Stage II.
- Can only be applied, if their assistant is a doctor/supportive role?
- All Illusionist must help the despair keep balance in the game; which means you're not allow to give specific players-
Information basis on the despairs (Decisions on the game component)
##### Stage III.
- You're able to kill only within a periodic timeframe, meaning; only the starting clause is counted out and ending clause-
Anything that's in between the game's middle zone or (third-chapter) you can manipulate.
