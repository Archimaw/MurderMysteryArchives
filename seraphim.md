## Seraphim
> These people are always watching the illusioners; every movement, sometimes (they can't tell the difference between themselves and illusioners)
#### Storyline
They were created by the despairs to cause more conflict and pain and revive the dead by prolonging the game.
#### Abilities
- They can heal any character in the game that hasn't been killed in the last (4) rounds or (if the despair allows)
- They can stop illusioners from doing devious things?
- They can give items to "players" on a round basis, depending on (situational pools)
#### Resiliences
- They can only be applied, if their assistant is a doctor & supportive role?
- They can't kill anyone at all, they're only supportive
- Illusioners can give them trouble with the game internally
#### Affinities
#### Seeking (First Affinity)
- Only can stop illusioners from specific tasks
#### Healing (Second Affinity)
- Can only be applied, if their assistant is a doctor/supportive role?
#### ???
- I couldn't think of a third one, I'm sorry?

> You can apply other rules to this, if you desire.
